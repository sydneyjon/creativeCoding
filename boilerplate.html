        <h1>WELCOME TO MAD LIBS</h1>
        <p>NEW LONDON, Conn. (AP) — Connecticut College is <span class="verb", style="color: pink">switching</span> to remote classes and suspending sports practices and indoor gatherings after more than 50 <span class="name", style="color: blue">students</span> tested positive for  <span class="noun", style="color: red">COVID</span>-19.<p>

            <p>Dean of <span class="name", style="color: blue">students</span> Victor Arcelus said in an <span class="adj", style="color: orange">important</span> email to <span classame, style="color: blue">students</span> and <span>staff</span> on Tuesday that quarantine rules will be in effect for up to 10 days while <span class="name", style="color: blue">officials</span> monitor <span class="adj", style="color: orange">critical</span>  test results.
            
            Arcelus said <span class="adj", style="color: orange">symptomatic</span> <span class="name", style="color: blue">students</span> and some of their <span class="noun", style="color: red">friend</span> got <span class="adj", style="color: orange">rapid</span> tests Monday and 20 <span class="name" style="color: blue">students</span> tested positive.
            
            “Through <span class="noun", style="color: red">contact</span> tracing, we determined that the <span class="name" style="color: blue">students</span> who had contracted the <span class="noun", style="color: red">virus</span> had been <span class="verb", style="color: pink">socializing</span> in <span class="noun", style="color: red">car</span>s, in friends’ <span class="noun", style="color: red">car</span>s or at <span class="location", style="color: purple">parties</span> or in <span class="location", style="color: purple">bar</span>s without wearing a <span class="noun", style="color: red">mask</span>,” he said.
            
            The results of routine <span class="noun", style="color: red">COVID</span> testing came in Tuesday and showed that an additional 34 <span class="name" style="color: blue">students</span> had tested positive, Arcelus said.</p>

        <p>College spokesperson Tiffany Thiele told The Day of New London that while some <span class="name" style="color: blue">students</span> have reported <span class="adj", style="color: orange">mild</span>  <span class="noun", style="color: red">COVID</span> symptoms there have been no hospitalizations. There are more than 1,800 <span class="name" style="color: blue">students</span> enrolled this fall at the New London-based private college.

            <span>Vaccionations</span> are required for <span class="name" style="color: blue">students</span>, faculty and staff unless they have an <span class="noun" style="color: red">exemption</span>. Thiele said 98% to 99% of <span class="name" style="color: blue">students</span> are vaccinated, and the school anticipates that 95% of faculty and staff will be vaccinated by their Sept. 20 deadline.</p>
